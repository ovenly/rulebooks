# Setup

Shuffle all cards and deal to each player 12 cards minus the player count (e.g., 7 cards each in a 5 player game). Players hold cards in hand, without revealing them. Remaining cards form a deck for future rounds.

# Gameplay

Gameplay takes place over 3 rounds, each with 7-10 turns depending on player count. On each turn, all players simultaneous choose one card from their hand and play it face down. Cards are then revealed simultaneously. Cards have no in-game function with the exception of the Wasabi and Chopsticks cards, described below. The remainder of each player's hand is passed to the left (variant: pass to the right in round 2). On the last turn, players will have received only one card which they must play (often with limited value). Scores for the round are tallied, and all cards except for Pudding cards are discarded. From the deck, a new hand is dealta, and play continues. Pudding cards are scored at the end of round 3. The player with the greatest total score is the winner. In the case of a tie, the player with the most Pudding wins!

**Wasabi.** Wasabi triples the value of the *next* Nigiri card you play. Place this Nigiri on top of the played Wasabi card.

**Chopsticks.** Chopsticks have no immediate effect when played. In a later turn, after revealing cards you may choose to exchange Chopsticks for a card in your hand, effectively playing 2 cards in 1 turn while maintaining the size of your hand. Yell "SUSHI GO!" when you take this action.

# Scoring

**Maki Rolls.** Maki Rolls vary in the number of Maki icons illustrated (upper left). The player with the most Maki icons earns 6 points, and the player with the second most Maki icons earns 3 points. Split ties evenly, rounding down. Rarely, this may make a player in second place earn more than players tied for first!

**Nigiri.** Egg Nigiri earns 1 point, Salmon Nigiri earns 2 points, and Squid Nigiri earns 3 points. A Wasabi triples the score for one card, if placed on top. An unpaired Wasabi scores nothing.

**Tempura & Sashimi.** Each set of 2 Tempura scores 5 points. Each set of 3 Sashimi scores 10 points. Incomplete sets score nothing.

**Dumplings.** The larger the set of Dumplings you have, the more points you score. 1 Dumpling = 1 point, 2 Dumplings = 3 points, 3 Dumplings = 6 points, 4 Dumplings = 10 points, 5+ Dumplings = 15 points.

**Chopsticks.** Chopsticks score nothing.

**Pudding.** FINAL SCORING ONLY. The player with the most Pudding scores 6 points. The player with the fewest Pudding scores -6 points. Ties are split, both in positive and in negative points. The fewest Pudding is no Pudding at all.
